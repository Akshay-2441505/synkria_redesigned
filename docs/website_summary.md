### CSS Styling (`global.css`, `homepage.css`, `communities.css`, `networking.css`):

*   **Global Styles (`global.css`):**
    *   Defines CSS variables for colors (gradients, neutrals, text), spacing, border-radius, shadows, transitions, and z-index.
    *   Includes basic resets, typography (Inter and Playfair Display fonts), and gradient text utility.

    *   General section styling (headers, badges, titles, descriptions).
    *   Animations for floating shapes and particles.
    *   Responsive design media queries.
    *   Custom scrollbar styling.

*   **Page-Specific Styles (`homepage.css`, `communities.css`, `networking.css`):**
    *   Extend global styles with specific layouts and visual elements for each page.
    *   Utilize flexbox and grid for layout.
    *   Includes styling for hero sections, cards (news, interest, feature, community, professional, event), filters, modals, and various interactive elements.
    *   Many styles are defined with explicit pixel values or relative units, but not using a utility-first framework.

### JavaScript Functionality (`global.js`, `homepage.js`, `communities.js`, `networking.js`):

*   **Global JavaScript (`global.js`):**
    *   Initializes GSAP plugins (`ScrollTrigger`, `TextPlugin`).
    *   Handles preloader animation.
    *   Manages navigation scroll effects and mobile menu toggling.
    *   Implements smooth scrolling for anchor links.
    *   Includes functions for creating particle effects and animating floating shapes.

    *   Manages parallax effects.
    *   Implements a global notification system and loading states.
    *   Utility functions for debounce and throttle.
    *   Exports global functions via `window.EduConnect`.

*   **Page-Specific JavaScript (`homepage.js`, `communities.js`, `networking.js`):**
    *   Manages data (mock data for news, communities, professionals, events).
    *   Dynamically renders content based on filters and 'load more' actions.
    *   Handles filter logic and state management.
    *   Initializes page-specific hero animations, section animations, and interactive elements.
    *   Manages modal interactions (opening, closing, content loading).
    *   Includes specific animations for hero sections (e.g., tagline animation on homepage, connection web on networking page).
    *   Exports page-specific classes (e.g., `Homepage`, `CommunitiesPage`, `NetworkingPage`).

### Current Animation Approach:

*   **GSAP:** Heavily used across all pages for various animations, including:
    *   Element entrance animations (fade, slide, scale, rotate).
    *   Scroll-triggered animations (`ScrollTrigger`).
    *   Continuous animations (floating, pulsing, spinning).
    *   Interactive hover effects for cards and buttons.
    *   Preloader and dynamic text animations.

*   **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** Used for simple fade-in scroll animations on various elements (`data-aos` attributes).

*   **Custom CSS Animations:** Some basic animations defined directly in CSS (e.g., `logoSpin`, `loadingProgress`, `float`).

### Summary of Current State:

The website has a well-defined structure with clear separation of concerns between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It already leverages GSAP for complex animations and Bootstrap for basic components. However, the styling is based on custom CSS, which will be replaced by Tailwind CSS and Flowbite. The existing GSAP animations will need to be adapted to the new utility-first styling approach, and Flowbite components will be integrated to streamline the UI development. The current JS structure is modular, which should facilitate the transition. The use of mock data suggests a client-side rendering approach for dynamic content. The request for
